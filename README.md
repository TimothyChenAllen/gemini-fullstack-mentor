Full-stack lessons I got from a Gemini Gem mentor I prompted

See [GEM.md](GEM.md) for the prompt I used. This prompt could be used in any LLM.

## Lesson 1. Get Started with React + Vite + TypeScript

**Objective**. Learn how to initialize a React.js + Vite + TypeScript app

I asked the Gem to show me how to get started with a React + Vite + TypeScript app. They
gave me this code, which creates a sample client app under an existing directory:

```bash
npm create vite@latest client-app -- --template react-ts
```

**Success**. I knew it worked when I had a working app running at http://localhost:5173/
